# Affective Movie Evaluator
A System to rate movie based on videos of audience reaction. The goal of this project is to
help the movie makers gauge audience reception of the movie, by analysing a small test audience's
initial reaction.

We hope that this work will also contribute to creation of smarter audience evaluators, that can gauge the
audiences mood and predict which type of content they are likely to enjoy.
