\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:org84b9c7c}

Movie production studios use test screening in order to determine whether their movies will succeed. Recently, internet movie distributors such as Netflix and Amazon have started taking more control of the production of their content, it is more beneficial for studios to re-edit their movie once they can predict that the product is going to fail. While there are automated sentiment analysis tools used to measure how well the audience reacts to test screening, most of the feedback is still taken from questionnaires and the audiences subjective evaluation.

We aim to provide an automated, movie evaluation system which is going to analyse the audience watching the movie and predict an overall score. Our system is intended to supplement the existing manual process of test screenings. We are not proposing a system to replace the existing subjective evaluations given by the audience.

The aim of this project is to develop a system that can evaluate how good a movie is, by analysing both face and body postures of the audience. In order for this to work we provide the system a video file consisting of audience reactions, and the system will tell us how good a movie is within a rating metrics, we will define later. It is important for us to state, that we are not proposing a real-time system here; the system accepts a recording of the raw data - which is currently defined as video file, and can be any other form of measurement - as the primary input.

A system like this can aid us develop further, a more general system that can evaluate how good a certain product or presentation is by analysing the audience reaction limited by a certain context. In our case the product is a movie, and how the audience reacts may depend on what genre of movie they are watching, or what kind of experience they were expecting beforehand. It is likely that our system may not work well without knowing these information. Systems like these are also related to computer vision with Emotion AI technologies, such as face based lie detectors, which uses the same techniques to work.

\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:orgf34e47c}
For a long time movie industry have used statistical modeling and machine learning to predict, the success of movies based on high level data. While there have been several works in early to mid 2000’s, which takes in multimedia information to form a representation for the user’s emotions \cite{Shiliang_Zhang_2008,wu2008interactive}, the earliest work we could find that specifically focus on movie scenes was by Soleyman et. al.

Quite recently, there have been interest in using deep learning techniques to analyse audiences facial data such as \cite{saha2018unsupervised}, to predict whether an audience enjoyed the movie, most notably research work that has been funded by The Walt Disney Company \cite{Deng_2017}. The purpose of their research is to use facial emotion recognition techniques, to analyse the emotion of the audience in order to improve the movies.

Research has shown that over 90\% of our communication can be non – verbal (Algorithmia, 2018). Non- verbal communication which includes facial expressions and body postures among others can be used to determine the emotional state of a human being. According to Paul Ekman (Ekman P, 1992), there are basically six types of human emotions namely:  happiness, sadness, disgust, fear, surprise, and anger. 

The system we are proposing is going to take in a video file of an audience reacting to a movie and attempts to determine whether the audience liked that movie. It will use emotion recognition and body pose to quantify the overall reaction in order to determine whether the viewer enjoyed the movie or not. 

Although, idea of such a system is not new, we have not been able to find an existing system that considers both body pose and facial emotion data to create a model that can predict. Previous work such as (V Ramanarayanan et al., 2015), which evaluates a presenter by using a very similar technique that we are planning, performed very poorly compared to the human judges. However, we are a bit more optimistic, since movies are designed to elicit certain emotional responses and audiences in average exhibit similar reactions. Such a system, maybe useful in the film industry to analyse the reactions of the test audience as a supplement to the usual questionnaires. 
The problem we are trying to solve is that film studios screens movies to test audience, and audience writes back a subjective feedback usually on paper. Our software is intended to complement the existing evaluation procedure, by providing an automated evaluation of audience's experience that is less subjective and provide a numerical score that represents audience's sentiment more accurately.

Affective Analysis is already used by marketing giants such as Coca-Cola to predict the effectiveness of their advertisement on target test audiences. Affective movie analysis could prove to be valuable to streaming services that distributes their own content and have more control over the productions such as NetFlix.

\chapter{Issues}
\label{sec:org628d238}
Our system is not real-time but still requires heavy computing power in order to run. This means the admin will often have to run multiple processes for analysis and come back later for the result. Our system does not support multiple processes yet, while it is possible for our system to run a process on a remote server or a cloud computer service via ssh and http, the admin still have to wait for the analysis to be completed. 

In order to minimize the scale of the problem, the first few iterations of the problem deals with only a single audience member. The largest audience we will be designing our system will be for a group of two to four person, under controlled lighting environment. Unless we have access to infrared cameras and better computing facilites, we will not be able to overcome these limitations. 

Our video can only have one person in front of the camera. The application is not able to give proper result if there are faces in the background when the audience member is reacting. Presence of another person in the room currently effects the resulting data, and it is very time consuming for a human to verify whether the recorded data does not have any background face. However, as we wrote our detection algorithm to choose the largest region of interest in the image, the fail cases we have observed usually consists of background posters and wallpapers with larger face than our subject.

One of the weakness we have is in the accuracy of the face detection algorithm. OpenCV's default facial detection algorithm, (Viola-Jones full frontal model) requires the audience member to face the camera directly. However, we plan to implement a more accurate face detection algorithm at the risk of increasing computing time.

Right now our system uses an externel media player known as VLC media player, to play the movie while being recorded in use case 1. The system admin is usually required to install the software manually. However on Windows based systems, it is sometimes not possible to find the 

\chapter{Benefits and Constraints}
\label{sec:orge59a6ef}
For our current iteration the system can analyse only one audience member. The reason for this limitation is that we initially wanted to start the project with a smaller scope and also to reduce the amount of tasks we might have for the first iteration. Even in our future iterations, we will not be analysing and audience consisting of more than a handful of person, unless we get better camera equipments.

Another issue faced by us is that facial emotion recogntion is not working that well, for now. In order to improve the accuracy of the \gls{FER} model we plan to write separate test cases.

Since our system takes a long time to analyse, we had to modify our "Analyse Video" use case into two seperate parts. Instead of directly providing a video file to run analysis and immediately getting the results and visualisations, our system actually requires the admin to run two seperate instance of analysis, facial emotion analysis (FER) and pose analysis (BEGR). Running an instance of analysis will produce the required data file, which can then be visualised as a time-series and processed to be sent for our movie evaluation ML model.


\chapter{Project Aims and Objectives}
\label{sec:org978475f}
The aim of our project is to develop a system that can evaluate how good a movie is, by analysing both face and body postures of the audience. In order for this to work we provide the system a video file consisting of audience reactions, and the system will tell us how good a movie is within a rating metrics, we will define later. It is important for us to state, that we are not proposing a real-time system here; the system accepts a recording of the raw data - which is currently defined as video file, and can be any other form of measurement - as the primary input.
\begin{itemize}
\item system like this is very useful for movie studios, which often relies on test audience in order to predict whether their movies are going to be successful and a system like this can aid in measuring the audience reaction more accurately.
\end{itemize}
The objectives we have set for our project are the following:
Define the metrics by which the system is going to give the score before we create the evaluation model. (e.g: value between 0.0-1.0 or a discrete grading system, like A+, A,  
\begin{itemize}
\item Research the requirements of the dataset, and methodologies before week 3.
\item Find or create the required test datasets for in order to complete objective 6.
\begin{itemize}
\item Dataset for the emotion recognition subsystem
\item Dataset for body pose subsystem.
\item Dataset for the whole system: Video recordings of audiences reacting to movies.
\item Determine accuracy of the overall project by comparing its output to existing scoring systems.
\end{itemize}
\item To prove that we are using state of the art technologies in our system; produce:
\begin{itemize}
\item Accuracy report for Emotion recognition
\item Accuracy report Body pose/action estimation
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Project Scope}
\label{sec:org5557a56}
\begin{itemize}
\item For developement purpose, we will be dealing with short movies mostly.
\item We will be recording atleast 12 subjects, watching multiple movies.
\end{itemize}

Before we proceed, we would like to borrow a very recent terminology from Andrej Karpathy that has been in use in the industry. \emph{Software 2.0} refers to any software that is written without direct human involvement, with the help of another software. We chose to use this term in document to highlight the fact that the developement approach and the documentation practices used for the machine learning portions of the code is slightly different than the rest, and it will not be honest from our part to describe the process as the same. Though term originated in an article he wrote, we have seen the term used within a very few academic papers \cite{ratner2018snorkel}. In contrast, \emph{Software 1.0} refers to any type of software that a human is directly responsible for creating and we will be only using the term to distinguish it, if necessary.

A large portion of the project is in Software 2.0, therefore we do realize we have to spend a lot of time collecting data, analysing the data and evaluating our application. For this reason our primary methodology is described as SEMMA methodology, even though for iteration 1 we actually use a mixed method.


\chapter{Software and Hardware Requirements}
\label{sec:orgc880798}

\section{Funding Sources}
\label{sec:org431996b}
As mentioned before we do not have any corporate and industry backing, therefore we are expecting HELP School of ICT to provide any possible funding we may require, if requested. Since the University already have most of the assets we require for our FYP1, we will require permission from the IT department to use the facilities, for our project.
As for FYP2, the tools and resources we require for data collection and obtaining ground truth can only be determined after we complete the first part of our project.

\section{Minimum hardware requirements}

\chapter{Developement Methodology}
\label{sec:orgc61ee8b}
To give you the context of the reasoning behind our decision, we would like to discuss a brief overview of commonly used development methodologies first. The most commonly followed methodologies for data-science projects are either SEMMA or CRISP-DR methodologies. SEMMA is a methodology developed by SAS institute, while CRISPR-DR method was originally developed in a joint effort by five companies, and further improved by data mining industry, most notably by IBM. 

The main difference between both methodologies are that CRISPR-DR considers business understanding of the process and also considers model deployment and the results. SEMMA is mainly used for data mining projects, which does not consider business aspect. The methodology we chose for our project is SEMMA methodology.

The reason we chose SEMMA is that, we wanted to keep option generalise our problem scope later, for example we wanted to apply what the system does in other scenarios than movies. Also, business project timelines and research project timelines are usually incompatible, and this is a fact we need to consider while planning early on, since machine learning projects falls under the latter. So not considering the business aspects of the project, will be an advantage for us given the time we  have. 

SEMMA methodology consists of 5 phases (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model and Assess). SEMMA methodology gives us freedom to reiterate from any step, as we require. It does not have a definitive cycle for iteration, which makes it a more simple and less rigid framework to follow, compared to CRISP-DR (Palacios, 2017). 
Sample:  First step of of SEMMA involves collecting all data samples.
Explore: Understand the problem through exploration of sample data. Exploration can be helped through visualisations and other data analytic tools.
Modify: Next steps, involves selecting which variables/features can be used, how they can be transformed or processed in order to create a model.
Model phase consists of selecting and creating a model
Assess: Finally we evaluate how well the model performed, and determine whether it is useful in real world situation.
In order to properly use SEMMA methodology into our project we are going to we are going to collectively apply the methodology to three separate components of our system that we have previously identified; the facial emotion subsystem, body emotion subsystem and movie evaluation model. After we started planning, we realized given only two team members, it was actually impossible for us to go through the whole system with one iteration within one semester. 

Therefore, we have split the project into two phases. Each phase is considered iteration by itself, because during the first phase, we build the first two components of our pipeline simultaneously (by two members), such that they both go through the SEMMA process at the same time. During the process, we also ensure both components are integrated before we start the next phase.

Then, we will start next iteration; go back to the sample stage to work on the final part of our project. For example, after the Assess phase of the emotion models we will be starting again from Sample phase again, and ensure everything in the pipeline is working well. This does not mean we define the term “phase”  and “iteration” as being interchangeable. 

Eventually, given the results it is possible we may plan a new iteration, if necessary. For example, if after assessing the Movie Evaluation Model, it performed poorly, we may go back to either Modify stage to pick better features to be passed into the model or we can even go back to Model stage to pick a different model.

The first planned iteration of  our project we will be focused on building the facial emotion and body pose emotion subsystem, which will be for simplicity hence referred to as “Emotion Model” and “Pose Model”, respectively. The second part of our project will be the combined system along with “Movie Evaluation Model”. Most of our work on Movie Evaluation Model, is currently planned to commence on the second part of our internship (FYP2), and the gantt chart we have proposed in the Appendix section might significantly change.

As our primary version control system we will be using gitlab as our github repository. Also, since SEMMA does not define a project management style, we will be using kanban/scrum like board feature on gitlab, to organize the tasks that we will be doing. However, we will not be adhering to any strict project management style, which is very prevalent in the software industry.

As for the specific techniques we will use throughout the development, our idea is to analyse existing literatures, and compare notes and follow general data mining/modeling techniques with fewer brainstorm sessions. In order to obtain the ground truth while collecting the data, our current idea is to use questionnaires after recording a subject’s reaction. Alternatively, it’s possible for us to measure blood pressure or any other means of observation if possible, and we will consider that for our FYP2.

\part{Project Management Plan}
\label{sec:orge941b3d}
\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:orga585a2d}
The aim of our project is to develop a system that can evaluate how good a movie is, by analysing both face and body postures of the audience. In order for this to work we provide the system a video file consisting of audience reactions, and the system will tell us how good a movie is within a rating metrics, we will define later.

A system like this is very useful for movie studios, which often relies on test audience in order to predict whether their movies are going to be successful and a system like this can aid in measuring the audience reaction more accurately. 

\section{OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT}
\label{sec:orgc3adf41}
The objectives we have set for our project are the following:
Define the metrics by which the system is going to give the score before we create the evaluation model. (e.g: value between 0.0-1.0 or a discrete grading system, like A+, A, B) 
 Research the requirements of the dataset, and methodologies before week 3.
Find or create the required test datasets for in order to complete objective 6.
Dataset for the emotion recognition subsystem
Dataset for body pose subsystem.
Dataset for the whole system: Video recordings of audiences reacting to movies. 
Determine accuracy of the overall project by comparing its output to existing scoring systems. 
To prove that we are using state of the art technologies in our system; produce:
Accuracy report for Emotion recognition 
Accuracy report Body pose/action estimation

\section{OUTPUTS EXPECTED FROM THE PROJECT}
\label{sec:orgecac589}

The project will be divided into two phases; initially, we will be working on two seperate system that capture the emotion and pose respectively, into meaningful data and then streamline our work into a single codebase. The second phase of our project will be working together to create the movie evaluation model, which takes in the processed data from our previous system and gives us a prediction of how well the audience liked that movie. 

The main focus of our project will be developing the Movie Evaluation Model that we have discussed earlier, in our project proposal. However, since the movie evaluation model we have proposed requires all the emotion data, we need to use a working emotion recognition system first. We may use any python/tensorflow based off the shelf or open source system for that purpose. 

The first part of our project is choosing and testing the preliminary subsystems of the pipeline. Note that since we use off the shelf code for the first phase of the project, there is no training dataset required, we expect that pre-trained models are provided by the library we choose. Also, in order to properly validate the system it is ideal to avoid using the original training dataset that was used to create the pre-trained model as our test datasets. 

The deliverables consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Facial emotion recognition subsystem. (Faith) 
\begin{itemize}
\item Data collection: Facial dataset and emotion dataset.
\item Evaluate facial detection library
\item Evaluate emotion recognition library
\end{itemize}
\item Test script
\begin{itemize}
\item Performance Report.
\end{itemize}
\item Body pose emotion (Body language) subsystem. (Ibrahim)
\begin{itemize}
\item Data Collection: Body pose data
\item Test script
\item Performance Report.
\end{itemize}
\item Integrated codebase: Contains code to load and run the previous two modules on a frame of a video file, and prepare data to feed the movie evaluation model.
\item Movie Evaluation model.
\item Collect movie dataset: Record audience reacting to movies.
\item Report
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Work Breakdown Structure}
\label{sec:org8645e58}
During our analysis phase we broke down the project into largest completable tasks for each phase. In-order to identify the completable tasks, we thought of the project in terms of user-story/use-case perspective and also by identifying the independent components of the system, from our analysis. We thought of the first input data that will pass through the pipeline, and how it will be processed along to get the results we wanted. For example, if our initial data is video files captured by a camera device, the system must have to at somepoint interact with a camera object, therefore it is very likely during our design phase that we may need to create a camera object for a module.

\part{Requirement Analysis}
\label{sec:orgdd65e35}
\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgc553fa8}
Since the conception of the project plan, our initial goal for the first iteration was to create a system that is going to analyse the facial emotion and body posture emotion independently and construct a data representation such as a time-series from the analysis. We delegated the primary goal of our project, which is to use that data to train and create a model that can score movies for later iterations intentionally, so it will give us time to reconsider our methods and also create dataset in between the downtime.

Like any other software developement project, our approach was to first of all analyse the system and identify. Practically, most of the requirement analysis was done while we were creating the project plan, while we did not thoroughly document it in the proposal itself. This part of the document was later updated to reflect the change in number of use-cases in our iteration 1, after we realised that we are not able to fit the three initial use-cases we planned into the first iteration.

Along with the project's functional requirements and non-functional requirements, we will also try to give an overview of the requirements from the machine learning perspective. We will try to state the ML problem, and define the requirements and structure for the problem. It should be noted by now, our system will consist multiple ML algorithms interacting with each other and a portion of has to be designed by us. 

We also wanted to complete all the software design and engineering intensive tasks as early as possible so we can focus on the machine learning aspects of our project. Thus, a large portion of this iteration is writing the code for user interaction, and designing processes within the system that can perform independent of the type of user interface.

Initially, we like we planned we worked on the facial analysis, and posture analysis portion of the code seperately. Later on we refactored and integrated the code as seperate modules into a single codebase with the help of object-oriented programming.

The first thing we did during our first meeting was infact to identify all the stakeholders and actors who interacted with the system. While we discussed the naming conventions of the actors involved during the later meetings, it was early on established that only one user directly interacts with the system and can be considered to be the primary user.

Our systems consists of mainly this one user controlling the application directly. Ideally this user is a system operator, hired by the production company with a knowledgeable background in IT and system administration. Throughout this document we refer to this user, simply as \emph{Admin}. We should note that the user \emph{Admin} is not really a recognized object within the system and thus does not have a login function. \emph{Admin} refers to whoever is operating the system.

\section{Actors and Stakeholders}
\label{sec:org6cf5990}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Admin
\label{sec:orgf682405}

An \emph{Admin} can use the system to record audiences watching a movie. Right now, in order to do that, the movie must exist within the computer system first. Admin is supposed to launch our application, and provide the details of the audience member and the movie, because the system does not yet store the metadata of the movies yet. The movie object is not considered as an object of the system in this iteration.

\begin{itemize}
\item Admin is able to Record a video of a \emph{Subject} watching a movie.
\item Admin is able to Analyse a video of a \emph{subject}
\begin{itemize}
\item Produce time-series.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item Subject
\label{sec:org6eeaa69}
Subject is not considered a primary actor in the system. The only interaction between the subject and the system occurs when the admin records the subject watching a movie in the first use-case. The admin initiates the use-case and subject passively sits infronts of the camera, until the movie is completed, whole while the admin actually have the control of the system such that they can terminate the recording process or wait until the movie is finished.

While the UML for iteration 1 might not directly hint that our system considers \emph{Subject} as a seperate entity for design purpose, it is going to be added as an Object in our future iteration. We did not include the \emph{Subject} as an object that is in the system, yet.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Object represented in the system}
\label{sec:org0b81b46}
For this iteration, all use-cases are going to be involved with only two object. Object Sample represents a sample recording of an audience video, while the object movie represents a Movie that an audience is watching. It is important that these two logical objects are well defined within the system, as we might later need to categorize and display the statistics for future use cases.

\chapter{Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:orgb3f5f5e}
\section{Use-Case Diagrams}
\label{sec:orge2b5ba7}
While designing of the use-cases we only thought from a logical/business perspective and not included the "technical" usecases, as our methodology and approach does not heavily rely on UML. 



\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{./img/auc.png}
\caption{\label{fig:auc}
Iteration 1: Before integration}
\end{figure}


In figure \ref{fig:auc}, you can see that the Analyse Video is bound within a subsystem of Affective Movie Evaluator. The reason

While there is a weak implementation of other use cases, the two use-cases shown in the diagram \ref{fig:auc}, are the main goal of our current iteration until now.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in]{./img/auc_exp.png}
\caption{\label{fig:auc}
Analyse uscase with subsystems}
\end{figure}


It would have been ideal for the sake of this documentation for Analyse use case to include two "technical" use-cases, "Analyse FER" and "Analyse BEGR", so that it is easier to credit the two team members, but it would not have been accurate. Ideally a use case should show an added value to a system, and seperating them does not really contribute the value to from either logical or design perspective.

\chapter{Non-Functional Requirements}
\label{sec:orgfa5469d}
\section{Technical Requirements}
\label{sec:orgb3e9e16}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Prototype 1 - BIT304
\label{sec:orgacf69ca}
We recommend to use a moderately powerful desktop computer to run the application. For video capture, it currently uses a webcam, though the application is currently compatible with any other type of live video capture stream. Ideally, a dual monitor system must be used one facing the audience and one facing the \emph{Admin}, who will be interacting with the control panel. The system was actually tested on a laptop computer and we assume that it is also possible to setup and run this application on most standard laptops without any issue. 

Almost all of our application is written using Python 3. We used the Anaconda distribution of python and it's environment and package management system because it reduced the compatibility issues associated with installing packages such as tensorflow across different systems.

Windows 7/8\\

\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Recommended Setup
\label{sec:orgedfe66c}
\begin{itemize}
\item Linux based system, preferrably Debian variant
\item System Utilites
\begin{itemize}
\item git
\item conda
\end{itemize}
\item Intel based processor preferrably greater than 5th Generation i5
\item 8GB RAM
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Usability Requirements}
\label{sec:org009bcf9}

Our standard user documentation is written as a README file in markdown format. Since the project is currently available in GitHub, the documentation is the first thing the user can see of our project. The purpose of the user documentation is to describe the whole project briefly, and guide the user to install and setup the application.

The user is able to interact with the application through commandline and GUI.

\section{Reliability Requirements}
\label{sec:org62e9a3b}
In our current iteration, all the files are stored in the filesystem within the project file. Our version control system (git) does not track the data files and models, since they are considered large and we do not think it will be effective to use VCS to track data files. Therefore, datasets and results must be shared and versioned manually, we will have to back it up separately and share it on internet with email and file sharing services.

One of the scripts we wrote that will run when a new user is going to setup the system, will actually download the pre-trained models used by subsystems from the internet. This seems to be a standard practice as even larger projects such as OpenPose often does not store their models in the github repository. 

\section{Security Requirements}
\label{sec:org74a3cac}
By design, our system does not have an authentication system nor it is considered required. We consider that if deployed, most production studios have their own security systems to control access.

The only time the application uses network currently is to access the internet and download the required models and software.

One concern a production studio may have is regarding the security of test audience data that is stored. Depending on the contract they have with their own test audience, the test audience may be concerned with their privacy if the data is leaked or shared without their permission for other projects.


\begin{enumerate}
\item FYP2
\label{sec:org5168e82}
We plan to implement the cloud analysis use-case for iteration 3.
\end{enumerate}

\part{Iterations}
\label{sec:org4b1e050}
\chapter{Iteration Plans}
\label{sec:orgd559865}
Early on we planned two iteration for FYP 1, but as mentioned in the requirement analysis we had to change that because of time constraint and risks of not completing the objectives of our FYP 1. 

As shown in our project timeline, we combined SEMMA phases with SDLC phases in our project timeline. The SEMMA phase are not analogous to an SDLC phase, and we've learned that there may exist no standard for such analogy. For example most software engineers and feature engineers tend to write code during the Sample phase while ML engineers may work on something else. For later iterations, we are going to follow the SEMMA phases more rigidly as we will be working more on the machine learning aspects of the project.


\section{Current Iteration}
\label{sec:org7d210b9}
We only have one Iteration for this part of our final year project.
Initially the work was divided between the two part.
Use case one was primarily developed by Ibrahim and designed by Faith.

Use-case two's main two sub-components were developed and tested independently and later on we re-integrated our work into a single codebase.

\chapter{Iteration 1}
\label{sec:orgb8bcbf8}
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org425976e}
Like we mentioned before this iteration implements only two use-cases, but it does not mean the amount of tasks we have is smaller than iteration 2, which we have planned that involves more use-cases. Our plan for this iteration was changed throughout the developement, project. Initially we had 2 iterations and considered adding more use-cases that manages movies and samples within the system. However once we finished our work breakdown and started to sort out our tasks, we figured out it will be a risk considering all the tasks we have and we might not be able to complete our goals within timespan. 

So iteration 1 was expanded to cover most of this semester and we focused on two use-cases from the user-perspective. From the system perspective, we started working on the two main analysis subsystems once our on use-case two commenced. 

\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:orgfad3e28}
The purpose of this iteration is mainly to make sure our application can record a video and extract the primary data, required for machine learning from the video. This means the two analysis subsystems must be designed tested, and they should be integrated into the system.

By the end of this iteration the system should be able to do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Capture Video}: The admin should be able to record video by using the command line interface and graphical user interface, to create a video file.
\item \textbf{Analyse Video}: The admin must be able to create time-series data from an existing recording of a subject.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Context}
\label{sec:org6895689}
On a grand scale, by the end of this iteration we will have a codebase and an fixed project structure. It should be easier to navigate and design for our future iterations, since we will be more familiar with how we are going to work and what exactly needs to be documented. Most importantly, the review of the first iteration is actually going to help us estimate and prioritize the tasks for future iterations because it is going to show how much we overestimate or under-estimate the size of a task.

\section{Evaluation Criterea}
\label{sec:orge02ab9c}

The criteria for evaluation of the whole system is divided into three parts. We intend to test the software 
\begin{enumerate}
\item FER Evaluation
\item BEGR Evaluation
\end{enumerate}

The approach to test the \emph{Software 1.0} parts and the \emph{Software 2.0} (machine learning) parts of the system are very different.
The software engineering aspects and machine learning parts of the code must be tested using very serpe

In this iteration we do not evaluate the speed and accuracy performance of the entire pipeline, from the beginning, something we intend to do in all the future iterations.


\section{Analysis and Design Artefacts}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pipeline diagrams
\label{sec:org555d3d3}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{img/pipeline.png}
\end{center}


Even though it is possible to run \emph{FER} and \emph{BEGR} simultaneous and in parallel by design, during the implementation phase we realised our development systems are not capable of  running the subsystems in parallel without running out of memory. Therefore, we decided that the video will pass through the analysis pipeline twice to exctract the time-series data.
